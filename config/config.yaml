#dataset
image_dir: data/CUB_200_2011/images # test image folder to run inference on'
data_dir: data/CUB_processed/filtered  # Path to the dataset directory with anotoated pickle files note that the data directory should contain the following files: 'train.pkl', 'val.pkl', 'test.pkl' not the images
n_attributes: False # Number of attributes in the dataset, if false find them automatically by loading the dataset
